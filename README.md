# FlowQuestJS

FlowQuest is an interactive flowchart and questionnaire JavaScript library all in one. It combines questions posed to users with an intelligent system of funneling to the necessary ends. To utilize it, all you need to provide is a schema JSON file that contains your questions, possible answers, and where you would like the user to be funneled to upon the particular answers.
